I am a PhD student in [Epidemiology](https://pophealth.wisc.edu/) (minor: Computer Science) at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, where I also completed my MS in [Statistics](https://www.stat.wisc.edu/) in 2016. My research focuses on statistical methods in spatial epidemiology, specifically working on spatial cluster detection and applications to environmental health. I am also a Project Assistant with the [CALS Statistical Consulting Lab](https://calslab.cals.wisc.edu/stat-consulting/) and volunteer as a [Data Carpentry](http://www.datacarpentry.org/) instructor/helper teaching R to UW-Madison researchers. I was a 2016 Data Science Fellow at [Data Science for Social Good](https://dssg.uchicago.edu/) and have worked at the University of Chicago Booth School of Business [Accounting Research Center](https://research.chicagobooth.edu/arc) as a Research Professional.
