I am a PhD student in Epidemiology at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, where I also completed my MS in Statistics in 2016. My research focuses on statistical methods in spatial epidemiology, specifically working on spatial cluster detection across both space/time and applications to environmental health. I am also a Project Assistant with the CALS Statistical Consulting Lab and volunteer as a Data Carpentry instructor/helper teaching R to UW-Madison researchers.
