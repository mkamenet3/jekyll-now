title: Predictive Enforcement of Pollution and Hazardous Waste Violations in New York State - Data Science for Social Good 2016
---
In the summer of 2016, I had the opportunity to work as a Data Science Fellow at [Data Science for Social Good Summer Fellowship](https://dssg.uchicago.edu/). My team (fellows Jimmy Jin, Dean Magee, and me; technical mentors Adolfo de Unanue & Eric Potash; project manager Paul van der Boor) worked alongside the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation (NYSDEC) to develop a predictive model that could identify facilities with high likelihood of violating environmental regulations.

Details on the project and conference video can be found [here](https://dssg.uchicago.edu/project/predictive-enforcement-of-pollution-and-hazardous-waste-violations-in-new-york-state/?portfolioCats=102%2C108).

Our final paper can be found [here](http://k2co3.net/assets/pdf/rcra_preprint.pdf).
